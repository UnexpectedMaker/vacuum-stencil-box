# Vacuum Stencil Box

This is the Fusion 360 parametric version of my Vacuum cleaner based solder stencil box for use with both framed and non-framed stencils.

# How does it work?

Simple download the `Vac_Bed_Dynamic_v7.f3d` file from the fusion360 folder, and import it into a project in Fusion360. Then open the "Change Parameters" window from the "Modify" menu and tweak as required.

# Support Unexpected Maker

I love designing, making and releasing my projects as open source. I do it because I believe itâ€™s important to share knowledge and give back to the community, like many have done before me. It helps us all learn and grow.

That said, a lot of time, effort and finances have gone into designing and releasing these files, so please consider supporting me by buying some of my products:
